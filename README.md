# Jarvis: A Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

Jarvis is a voice-activated virtual assistant designed to perform a variety of tasks including fetching news, opening websites, playing music, and interacting with OpenAI's GPT model. It utilizes speech recognition to process voice commands and provides responses via text-to-speech.

## Features
- **Open Websites**: Access popular websites like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
- **Play Music**: Stream music from a predefined library.
- **Fetch News**: Retrieve the latest news headlines from NewsAPI.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Respond to general queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moiz14553/jarvis-voice-assistant.git
cd jarvis-voice-assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File (Optional)
Store your API keys in a `.env` file to avoid hardcoding them in the code. Example:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
```

### 4. Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 gtts pygame requests openai
```

## Configuration

### OpenAI API
To use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, you need an API key:
- Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate an API key.
- Replace `openai.api_key` in the code with your API key.

### NewsAPI
For news functionality, obtain an API key from:
- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Replace the `newsapi` variable in the code with your API key.

## Music Library

Jarvis can play music from a predefined library. Here are some example tracks:

```python
music = {
    "mashup": "https://youtu.be/5fYpYPzEWDY?si=RRTm00ZLLRmM3Vuk",
    "mashup2": "https://youtu.be/rDe6QJ4AGQE?si=Zfqn4GCEPXnpPoSD",
    "yadey teri": "https://youtu.be/15cxCut_WZQ?si=tqjGXheO6rNdGzHA",
    "coke studio": "https://youtu.be/0SkXKAY5rRQ?si=pgoCKH2xHl3ND1tS"
}
```

You can issue commands like:
- "Jarvis, play mashup."
- "Jarvis, play yadey teri."

## OpenAI Integration

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a virtual assistant named Jarvis skilled in general tasks like Alexa and Google Cloud."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is coding?"}
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message['content'])
```

## Running the Assistant

To run Jarvis, execute:
```bash
python client.py
```

### Usage
1. **Wake Word**: The assistant listens for the wake word "Jarvis." Once detected, it becomes active.
2. **Voice Commands**: After activation, you can issue commands such as:
   - "Open Google"
   - "Play [song name]"
   - "Tell me the news"
   - Ask general questions

### Example Commands
- "Jarvis, open Google."
- "Jarvis, play [song name]."
- "Jarvis, tell me the news."
- "Jarvis, what is the weather like today?"

## Troubleshooting

- **No Wake Word Detection**: Ensure your microphone is working properly. The assistant listens for "Jarvis."
- **API Errors**: Verify that your API keys are correctly set in the code or `.env` file.
